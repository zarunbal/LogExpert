# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Project Overview

LogExpert is a Windows log file viewer and analyzer built with C# and Windows Forms. It's a GUI replacement for the Unix `tail` command with extensive features including tail mode, filtering, bookmarks, highlighting, and a plugin-based architecture for parsing custom log formats.

**Key Technologies:**
- .NET 10.0 (Windows target framework)
- Windows Forms for UI
- Nuke Build System with MSBuild
- NUnit for testing
- Plugin-based architecture

## Environment

This is a Windows .NET/WinForms repo. Python is often unavailable — prefer PowerShell, `tshark`, and built-in tooling. Check whether `gh` CLI (and any other external tool) is actually installed before building a plan around it. The active GitHub account is `brunerpat`.

### Line Endings

The working tree is CRLF on Windows (only `usedComponents.json` is pinned to LF via [.gitattributes](.gitattributes); there is no global normalization). Never use `sed`-based or other text-tool renames that strip line endings — they produce a whole-file diff of pure line-ending churn. After any bulk rename, verify no references were left unrenamed (a missed reference will break the build).

## Testing

Follow TDD for all bug fixes: write a failing test that reproduces the issue first, then fix, then verify the **full suite** passes — not just the new test in isolation (timing/filesystem tests can pass alone but fail alongside the suite).

## Documentation

Docs must be code-grounded and reconciled against the actual source and live config, then reader-tested before delivery. Don't document from assumption.

## Refactoring

For "behavior-preserving" refactors, explicitly confirm equivalence and flag any unintended logic changes before applying.

## Build Commands

### Using Nuke Build (Recommended)

```powershell
# Build the solution
./build.ps1

# Clean and build
./build.ps1 --target Clean Compile

# Run tests
./build.ps1 --target Test

# Full release build with packages
./build.ps1 --target Clean Pack CreateSetup --configuration Release
```

#### How the Nuke build works

- `build.ps1` bootstraps and runs the Nuke build defined in [build/Build.cs](build/Build.cs). Targets and their dependencies are declared there in C#.
- **Default target is `Test`** (which depends on `Compile`), so a bare `./build.ps1` restores, compiles, and runs the tests.
- Select targets with `--target <Name>` (space-separated for multiple). Common targets: `Clean`, `Restore`, `Compile`, `Test`, `Pack`, `CreateSetup`, `GeneratePluginHashes`, `Publish`.
- List all available targets: `./build.ps1 --help`
- Preview the execution plan without running it: `./build.ps1 --plan`
- Pick build configuration with `--configuration Debug|Release` (defaults to `Debug` locally, `Release` on CI).

### Using .NET CLI Directly

```bash
# From src/ directory
dotnet restore
dotnet build --no-restore
dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

# Run specific test project
dotnet test src/LogExpert.Tests/LogExpert.Tests.csproj
```

### Important Build Notes

- **Windows-only**: This project requires Windows and .NET 10.0.100 SDK (specified in [global.json](global.json))
- **Cannot build on Linux/macOS**: Uses Windows Desktop SDK and Windows Forms
- Nuke build automatically downloads the correct .NET SDK version if needed
- Output directory: `bin/(Debug|Release)/`

## Architecture

### High-Level Structure

The codebase follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
LogExpert/
├── LogExpert/              # Main application entry point and UI orchestration
├── LogExpert.Core/         # Core business logic, log reading, filtering
├── LogExpert.UI/           # Windows Forms UI components and dialogs
├── LogExpert.Resources/    # Localization resources
├── LogExpert.Configuration/# Configuration management
├── ColumnizerLib/          # Plugin interface definitions
├── PluginRegistry/         # Plugin discovery and security
└── Columnizers/            # Built-in columnizer plugins (CSV, JSON, Regex, etc.)
```

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Single Instance Mode with IPC
- Application uses a Mutex to ensure single instance per session
- Named pipes (`LogExpertInstanceMutex{sessionId}`) for inter-process communication
- Secondary instances send file paths to primary instance via JSON over named pipes
- See [Program.cs](src/LogExpert/Program.cs) for implementation

#### 2. Plugin System
- **Columnizers** (`ILogLineColumnizer`): Parse log lines into columns
- **File System Plugins** (`IFileSystemPlugin`): Support non-local file sources (e.g., SFTP)
- **Context Menu Plugins** (`IContextMenuEntry`): Add custom menu items
- **Keyword Actions** (`IKeywordAction`): React to keywords in logs
- Plugin discovery happens at startup via `PluginRegistry`
- Plugins are loaded from `plugins/` and `pluginsx86/` directories
- Security: Plugin hashes are verified against generated hashes (Release builds only)
- See [PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](src/docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for details

#### 3. Log File Reading
- Abstract base class: `PositionAwareStreamReaderBase`
- Implementations: `PositionAwareStreamReaderSystem`, `PositionAwareStreamReaderLegacy`
- Uses buffered streams for efficient reading of large files
- Supports encoding detection (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 with BOM)
- Position tracking for tail mode and seeking
- See [src/LogExpert.Core/Classes/Log/](src/LogExpert.Core/Classes/Log/) for implementations

#### 4. Configuration Management
- Centralized via `ConfigManager.Instance`
- Initialized with application startup path and screen information
- Supports import/export of settings
- Persists user preferences, columnizer history, highlight masks, etc.
- Configuration stored in application startup directory (portable mode)

#### 5. Windows Forms UI Architecture
- MDI interface with tab support via `AbstractLogTabWindow`
- Main window created in [LogTabWindow.cs](src/LogExpert.UI/Dialogs/LogTabWindow/)
- Custom controls: `BufferedDataGridView`, `LogTabControl`, `DateTimeDragControl`
- High DPI considerations: Avoid `AutoScaleMode` and `AutoScaleDimensions` on individual controls
- Dark mode support via `Application.SetColorMode()`

### Critical Files and Their Purposes

- [Program.cs](src/LogExpert/Program.cs) - Application entry point, IPC setup, single instance handling
- [AbstractLogTabWindow.cs](src/LogExpert.UI/Extensions/LogWindow/AbstractLogTabWindow.cs) - Main window factory and orchestration
- [ILogLineColumnizer.cs](src/ColumnizerLib/ILogLineColumnizer.cs) - Core plugin interface for columnizers
- [ColumnizerPicker.cs](src/LogExpert.Core/Classes/Columnizer/ColumnizerPicker.cs) - Automatic columnizer detection
- [PluginRegistry.cs](src/PluginRegistry/) - Plugin discovery and security verification
- [ConfigManager.cs](src/LogExpert.Configuration/) - Configuration persistence and management
- [LogBuffer.cs](src/LogExpert.Core/Classes/Log/LogBuffer.cs) - In-memory log line caching

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Columnizer Plugin

1. Create new project in `src/` following naming pattern `*Columnizer`
2. Add project reference to `ColumnizerLib`
3. Implement `ILogLineColumnizer` interface
4. Add project to `src/LogExpert.sln`
5. Create corresponding test project in `Tests/` folder
6. Plugin will be auto-discovered at runtime from output directory

### Modifying Core Log Reading Logic

- Core reading classes are in [src/LogExpert.Core/Classes/Log/](src/LogExpert.Core/Classes/Log/)
- Inherit from `PositionAwareStreamReaderBase` for custom stream readers
- Key methods to implement: `ReadLine()`, `Position` property, `Seek()`
- Always maintain position tracking for tail mode support

### Working with Windows Forms UI

- UI components in `LogExpert.UI` project
- Follow existing High DPI patterns (no AutoScale on controls)
- Test with both light and dark mode (see `SetDarkMode()` in Program.cs)
- Use localization resources from `LogExpert.Resources` project
- Windows Forms designer files: `*.designer.cs`

### Test Setup & Conventions

- Unit tests use NUnit framework with Moq for mocking
- Test projects follow naming pattern `*.Tests`
- Test data stored in `TestData/` directories within test projects
- Run all tests: `./build.ps1 --target Test`
- Run specific test: `dotnet test src/LogExpert.Tests/LogExpert.Tests.csproj`

## Important Patterns and Conventions

### Code Style
- Nullable reference types enabled (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`)
- `.editorconfig` is the source of truth for formatting and analyzer severities — match it rather than imposing your own style; don't fight or override its rules
- ImplicitUsings enabled
- Assembly signing enabled (Key.snk)

### Configuration Files
- **Directory.Build.props** - Common MSBuild properties for all projects
- **Directory.Packages.props** - Centralized NuGet package version management
- **global.json** - .NET SDK version pinning (10.0.100)
- **.editorconfig** - Code style and analysis rules

### Project Organization
- Solution folders: "Columnizers", "Tests", "docs", "setup"
- Test projects nested under "Tests" solution folder
- Columnizer projects nested under "Columnizers" solution folder
- Documentation in `src/docs/` included in solution

### Git Workflow
- Default branch: `Development` (use for PRs)
- Commit format: **Do not** add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer (or any other agent/AI attribution) to commit messages
- GitHub Actions run on push to Development branch
- AppVeyor is the second CI for builds and artifact creation. It is currently disabled and needs to be re-added alongside GitHub Actions

## Plugin Security System

**Release builds only:**
- After compilation, `PluginHashGenerator.Tool` generates SHA256 hashes of all plugins
- Hashes stored in [PluginHashGenerator.Generated.cs](src/PluginRegistry/PluginHashGenerator.Generated.cs)
- At runtime, `PluginRegistry` verifies plugin hashes before loading
- Users can trust new plugins via UI dialog
- Hash updates automated via GitHub Actions on successful builds
- See [PLUGIN_HASH_MANAGEMENT.md](src/docs/PLUGIN_HASH_MANAGEMENT.md)

## Common Gotchas

1. **Cross-platform builds fail**: This is Windows-only. Don't attempt Linux/macOS builds.
2. **SDK version mismatch**: Must use .NET 10.0.100 SDK (specified in global.json)
3. **Plugin not loading**: Check output directory - plugins must be in `plugins/` or `pluginsx86/`
4. **High DPI issues**: Never use AutoScaleMode on individual controls, only on forms
5. **IPC failures**: Named pipes require proper Windows permissions and session isolation
6. **Encoding detection**: BOM-less files default to encoding from EncodingOptions
7. **Plugin hashes**: Only verified in Release builds; Debug builds skip verification

## Dont Do that

Hard rules — never do these:

- **Don't add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer** (or any other agent/AI attribution) to commit messages.
- **Don't attempt Linux/macOS builds.** This is Windows-only (Windows Desktop SDK + Windows Forms).
- **Don't use `AutoScaleMode` or `AutoScaleDimensions` on individual controls** — only on forms (High DPI).
- **Don't override or fight `.editorconfig` rules** — it is the source of truth for formatting and analyzer severities.

## Key Dependencies

- **NLog**: Logging framework
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: JSON serialization (legacy, but widely used)
- **CsvHelper**: CSV parsing in CsvColumnizer
- **SSH.NET**: SFTP support in SftpFileSystem plugins
- **DockPanelSuite**: Docking panel UI controls
- **Moq/NUnit**: Testing frameworks

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in `LogExperts/LogExpert` GitHub Issues, read-only for skills via the `gh` CLI — analysis only; only humans post. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical triage roles map to repo labels (`needs-info` → `question`; the rest use default names), used to read/filter issues — skills don't apply labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

# Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Clarify Before Executing

**Resolve ambiguity up front — before spawning agents or starting any autonomous work.**

Do this in order, then stop and ask before proceeding:

1. **Understand the request.** Read what was asked closely and state your assumptions explicitly.
2. **Inspect the codebase.** Check the relevant code, conventions, and existing patterns. Note anything that's unclear or that could be interpreted in more than one way.
3. **Ask.** Raise every consequential question now, batched together — don't pick an interpretation silently, and don't defer the question into the work itself.

Throughout:

- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't choose one silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- Don't invent APIs. Confirm a function, flag, or endpoint exists — and check its signature — before calling it. If you can't verify it, say so rather than guessing.

Only once these questions are resolved do you move to execution (§4).

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you spot problems outside your task — dead code, bugs — mention them; don't fix or delete them unless asked.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Begin only once §1's questions are resolved. Then turn the task into a verifiable goal with an observable check. A passing test is the strongest check; a clean typecheck, running it and inspecting output, or diffing against expected output also count.

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
- "Update the config" → "Apply it, start the service, and confirm the setting takes effect"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

When no obvious check exists (docs, exploration, some one-off scripts), ask how to verify success before starting. Don't report success you haven't actually observed.

Strong, agreed-upon criteria — settled in §1 — let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") force constant clarification, which is why §1 comes first.

## 5. Delegate Grunt Work Down a Tier

**Spend the capable model on judgment; push mechanical, low-context work to a cheaper model.**

Act as an orchestrator. Fan out grunt work — reading files, gathering context, simple searches, minor mechanical edits, other simple tool calls — to cheaper agents, then review their findings and any code changes yourself before acting on them. Keep the important and dangerous work — architecture, ambiguous decisions, risky or hard-to-reverse edits, final review — on the more capable model.

Which tier to spawn depends on who you are:

- **If you are Fable 5**, spawn Opus 4.8 agents for grunt work that still needs some capability; for genuinely simple tasks, hand off directly to Sonnet 5 instead. Review what they return.
- **If you are Opus 4.8**, and a task needs little knowledge or context, fan out to Sonnet 5 agents and review what they return.

Match the model to the task: pick the cheapest tier that can do the job well, and skip an intermediate tier when the work is simple enough for a lower one.

Guidelines:

- Only delegate work that is genuinely low-context and low-risk. If doing it well requires the capable model's judgment, keep it.
- Give each agent a self-contained task with clear success criteria (per §4) so you can verify its output without redoing the work.
- Never merge a delegated finding or edit unblocked — review it first. The cheaper model did the legwork; you own the decision.
