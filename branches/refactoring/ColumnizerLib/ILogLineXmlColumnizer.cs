  /// When in XML mode, LogExpert will scan for XML fragmets. These fragments are defined by opening
  /// and closing tags (e.g. &lt;log4j:event&gt; and &lt;/log4j:event&gt;). Every fragment is 
  /// transformed by using a XSLT template. The result of the transformation (which may be multi-lined) 
  /// is splitted into single lines. These single lines are the lines you will see in LogExpert's display.

  /// <li>The fragments will be translated using the given XSLT (<see cref="GetXmlLogConfiguration"/>)
  ///     The result is one or more lines of text content. These lines will be the lines LogExpert will 'see'
  ///     in its internal buffer and line management. They will be handled like normal text lines in other 
  ///     (non-XML) log files.
  /// </li>
  /// <li>The lines will be passed to the usual <see cref="ILogLineColumnizer"/> methods before displaying. So you can handle
